# 21-344 Final Project
Final Project for 21-344 (Numerical Linear Algebra) Spring 2021

Greetings! If you've stumbled on this page, you either (1) read my 21-344 Course Project Paper or (2) are browsing through my Github account for some reason. 
My final project for 21-344 was on Discrete-Time Markov Chains. In this Github repository, you can see some of the work I did for the project.

Here are some brief descriptions of the files: 

- 21-344_Final_Project_Code.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code that I wrote for my project
- Weather_PGH.xlsx: Pittsburgh weather dataset that I used for the dataset, consisting of 731 entries (May 10th 2019-May 9th 2021).
- 21-344_final_presentation.pdf: PDF-version of the slides I used for my presentation on May 14th, 2021
- 21-344_final_report.pdf: PDF of my final report, including a PDF-version of the Jupyter notebook
